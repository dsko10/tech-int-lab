                    Damian started playing motorsport games in the early 2000’s with titles such as Official Formula One Racing, F1 Racing Championship, and Grand Prix 4.

                <p class="card-text">
                    He then discovered the world of online racing, where he then moved to F1 Challenge 99-02 with a community mod to put 2007 cars and tracks into the game, and he did his first online race back in 2007 on August 14th.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    After a short period with that title, Damian moved to rFactor 1 in the early parts of 2008.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    He bought his first steering wheel and continued to race on the platform until 2014 when he decided to step down from sim racing, to pursue an esports career in non-motorsport games.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Damian made his comeback into sim racing in mid 2020, after a friend of his convinced him to do so, and after a successful campaign in the 2021 Formula SimRacing Academy series, where he claimed the driver’s title, he joined Burst Esport at the end of that year.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Damian is a mature driver, who has a great balance of being aggressive and staying patient to wait for the right moment. He’s taken a big step from the FSR Academy series, up to the World Championship division in 2022. The Pole has the talent and his biggest achievements are still yet to come.
